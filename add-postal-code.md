# Add Postal Code

The first step in the set up of the plugin is adding postal codes. This can be accomplished in two ways -- 

1. Using the **Add New Postal Code** tab, and
2. Using the **Bulk Import** tab

This section will discuss the walkthrough of each process step-by-step.

### Add New Postal Code

Navigate to **WooCommerce** &gt; **Zip/Pin/Postal Code Validator** and click on the **Add New Postal Code** tab.

First, fill the postal code in the **Zip / Pin / Postal Code** field. You can either enter one postal code, or enter multiple codes separated by commas.

The next section enables configuration for **Products**, **Payment Gateways** and **Shipping Methods**.

#### PRODUCTS

You can select products from the list here, which are auto-populated from the store, and choose to either **Allow** or **Block**. 

* If you select **Allow**, only these products are allowed for this postal code.
* If you select **Block**, these products are blocked while other products are allowed.
