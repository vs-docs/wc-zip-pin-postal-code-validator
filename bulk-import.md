# Bulk Import

The [**`Add New Postal Code`**](add-postal-code.md) ****method works best for adding limited number of postal codes, or to perform incremental updates, or modify existing pincodes. However, if you have a large number of postal codes, the best way to move forward is to use the **Bulk Import**. 

The **Bulk Import** steps are demonstrated in this section.
