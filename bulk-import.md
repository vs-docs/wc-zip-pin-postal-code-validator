# Bulk Import

The [**`Add New Postal Code`**](add-postal-code.md) ****method works best for adding limited number of postal codes, or to perform incremental updates, or modify existing pincodes. However, if you have a large number of postal codes, the best way to move forward is to use the **Bulk Import**. 

The **Bulk Import** steps are demonstrated in this section.

First, open the **Bulk Import** tab and download the _Sample File_

Once the _CSV sample file_ is downloaded, you can populate the fields as demonstrated below.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not change the first row of the CSV file.** Changing this can cause import errors.
{% endhint %}

As the first step, add **postal code**, **country**, **state** and **city**, one per line.

**Products:** There are two ways to handle products.

1. You can **allow** only specific products for this pincode, or
2. You can **block** specific products for this pincode
